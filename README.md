# KeyReader
A portable utility for securely storing keys/passwords.

I made this a while ago, so I thought I would upload it here.

# How to use this project

When you start this project, this will be the first thing you see.

The 'create key' dialog contains the following options:
* Encrypt Key: This specifies if the key should be encrypted with the specified password. If this is unchecked, anyone with a copy of this program can open it
* Password: Self explanatory
* Confirm Password: See above
* Key Content: This is where you put the key/password
* Show/Hide Key: Toggles the visibility of the aforementioned feild.
* Create Key: Opens the save dialog to create the .key file.

***
This is what you will see if you open an encrypted key file. If you open a non-encrypted file, you won't see this page.

Type in the password, and if it is correct, it will take you to this screen.

Here you have the following options:
* Reveal Key: Clicking this will show the key/password in plain text, double clicking again will hide the key.
* Copy to Clipboard: Copies the plain-text key/password to the clipboard without showing it on screen.
